Also found in colophon (see TibSkrit) to Mati paṇ chan's ""Sgra'i bstan bcos ka lā pa'i mdo'i rnam bshad legs sbyar rab gsal snang ba"". D1611's colophon states that he is the student of byang chub rtse mo (P2388). For further research aimed at identifying this figure, one may investigate P3091 and P0RK889, who have similar names but, based on the most readily available evidence, appear to have lived in the 13th century.",,,,,,,,,

Given the lack of other references to this translator, and given that Shes rab rin che (P79) invited Darpaṇācārya to Tibet and worked with him in the same places where Zhe sdang rdo rje did, it is possible that Zhe sdang rdo rje is an initiatory name of Shes rab rin chen. More research is required to confirm or refute this.",,,,,,,,
