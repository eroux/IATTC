Āryaśūra III, author of Subhāṣitaratnakaraṇḍakakathā, is probably 10th century or so. In Tibetan tradition, Āryaśūra or Śūra is generally treated as just another name for Aśvaghoṣa (and even Mātṛceta/Maticitra as well, although here there is some discussion in the sources) and even further as a name for (the 7th century) Vāgbhaṭa (sometimes the latter is given over 20 names!).
